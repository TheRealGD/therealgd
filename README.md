Fork of [Postmill](https://gitlab.com/edgyemma/Postmill) - social link aggregator/forums-website with voting and threaded comments. 
 - Built with [Symfony](https://symfony.com/)
 - Original Project is merged back & tracked in PR #200

## Requirements

* Ubuntu 16.04 or any UNIX-like OS with ruby, python, pip, docker & docker-compose installed

## Getting started

Recommended way to run this is on Ubuntu 16.04 - run `./install.sh` - this should give you everything you need.
Then: `./dev-local.sh` for no-HTTPS local development (will create containerized DB & one site admin account dev/devdevdev)
For HTTPS with certbot & config from AWS SSM - `./dev-aws.sh`
